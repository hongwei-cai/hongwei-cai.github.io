            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <h2>Programmer & Computer Scientist</h2>
            <p>My first exposure to programming came several years ago as I programmed several patches for live-electronic music using Max, a visual programming language for music and multimedia. One of my recent electronic music compositions is entitled “Collapsing Shells” for solo double bass and live electronics. It was based on astrophysical conjectures related to the “frozen star” paradox as predicted by the theory of General Relativity. I programmed a real-time sound sampling program to interact with the bassist’s playing, creating a sci-fi atmosphere. Through this initial experience and subsequent experiences, I have become intrigued with the prospect and potential of integrating music composition with computer technologies. I believe that composition and technology can go hand-in-hand because the components of a piece of music – pitch materials, dynamics, duration of notes, articulations, tempi, pulses, and rhythms are data that can be analyzed, processed, and systemized using computer technologies. In fact, an increasing number of composers collaborate with machine learning engineers to explore the possibilities of composing music with AI. </p><br>

            <h2>Composer & Pianist</h2>
            <p>Drawing inspiration from literature, philosophy, religion, paintings, science, and technology, Hongwei Cai’s music has always shown a particular fondness for using various forms of sonic representation to convey narrative imagination, with a special focus on themes of love and humanity. He has composed music for a wide range of ensembles, skillfully blending idiomatic writing with unique sound effects to create a distinctive voice in our generation. Through collaborations with both university-level musicians and world-class artists, his compositions showcase a complex conceptualization and practical execution.</p>

            <p><b>Hongwei Cai</b>, a Chinese composer and pianist, is currently a Ph.D. candidate in music composition at the University of Iowa. His works have been performed by the <em>Ensemble Dal Niente</em>, the <em>University of Michigan’s Contemporary Directions Ensemble</em>, the <em>University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music Chamber Orchestra</em>, the <em>University of Iowa Center for New Music</em>, the <em>Ensemble Accroche Note</em>, and the <em>JACK Quartet</em>. His music has been presented at venues including the 2021 Society of Composers Online National Conference, the Midwest Graduate Music Consortium (University of Michigan in 2021), the Midwest Composers’ Symposium (University of Michigan in 2017, University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music in 2018 and University of Indiana in 2019), and the Exchange of Midwest Collegiate Composers (University of Iowa in 2018). Hongwei Cai received a MM degree in composition from Oklahoma City University, and a Bachelor of Literature in composition and theory from Shenyang Conservatory of Music in China.</p>
