      </div>
      <h3>My current academic goal is to obtain a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Iowa</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <p>My first exposure to programming came several years ago as I programmed several patches for live-electronic music using Max, a visual programming language for music and multimedia. One of my recent electronic music compositions is entitled “Collapsing Shells” for solo double bass and live electronics. It was based on astrophysical conjectures related to the “frozen star” paradox as predicted by the theory of General Relativity. I programmed a real-time sound sampling program to interact with the bassist’s playing, creating a sci-fi atmosphere. Through this initial experience and subsequent experiences, I have become intrigued with the prospect and potential of integrating music composition with computer technologies. I believe that composition and technology can go hand-in-hand because the components of a piece of music – pitch materials, dynamics, duration of notes, articulations, tempi, pulses, and rhythms are data that can be analyzed, processed, and systemized using computer technologies. In fact, an increasing number of composers collaborate with machine learning engineers to explore the possibilities of composing music with AI. </p>

      <h3>Before becoming a CS professional, I was passionate about composing music and playing the piano</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <p>Drawing inspiration from literature, philosophy, religion, paintings, science, and technology, Hongwei Cai’s music has always shown a particular fondness for using various forms of sonic representation to convey narrative imagination, with a special focus on themes of love and humanity. He has composed music for a wide range of ensembles, skillfully blending idiomatic writing with unique sound effects to create a distinctive voice in our generation. Through collaborations with both university-level musicians and world-class artists, his compositions showcase a complex conceptualization and practical execution.</p>
        <p><b>Hongwei Cai</b>, a Chinese composer and pianist, is currently a Ph.D. candidate in music composition at the University of Iowa. His works have been performed by the <em>Ensemble Dal Niente</em>, the <em>University of Michigan’s Contemporary Directions Ensemble</em>, the <em>University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music Chamber Orchestra</em>, the <em>University of Iowa Center for New Music</em>, the <em>Ensemble Accroche Note</em>, and the <em>JACK Quartet</em>. His music has been presented at venues including the 2021 Society of Composers Online National Conference, the Midwest Graduate Music Consortium (University of Michigan in 2021), the Midwest Composers’ Symposium (University of Michigan in 2017, University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music in 2018 and University of Indiana in 2019), and the Exchange of Midwest Collegiate Composers (University of Iowa in 2018).

            <strong>Collapsing Shells</strong> was inspired by the astrophysical conjectures related to the “frozen star” paradox phenomenon predicted by General Relativity. The paradox was first introduced by Oppenheimer and Snyder in 1939, who found that gravitational collapse in vacuum produces a “frozen star”, i.e., the collapsing matter only asymptotically approaches the gravitational radius (event horizon) of the mass, but never crosses it within a finite time for an external observer</p>

        <div class="workContent">
          <p><strong><em>Collapsing Shells</em></strong> was inspired by astrophysical conjectures related to the “frozen star” paradox, a phenomenon predicted by General Relativity. During the gravitational collapsing of a star, the clock inside the shell slows down as the dust shells collapse toward the existing black hole. In real astrophysical settings, matter can pass through the event horizon of the black hole according to the clock of the external observer and will not accumulate around the black hole. In this case, when matter falls towards a black hole, it will not form a “frozen star” to the external observer. Through this work, I attempt to depict the phenomenon by creating several combinations of gestures for the soloist with guided improvisations and a series of Max patches.</p>

        <div class="workContent">
          <p>Poppies, tied deeply to sleep, peace, and death, has long been a symbol to fallen soldiers. My second string quartet, <strong><em>Poppies bursting into bloom in the wind and rain</em></strong>, is a response to Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae’s war poem In Flanders Fields. May the world be at peace forever and may you and my heart be at peace forever. The work is dedicated to those spirits who have suffered from war.</p>

            <h4>In Flanders Fields</h4>
            <p>by John McCrae (1872-1918)</p>
            <p>In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br>
              Between the crosses, row on row,<br>
              That mark our place; and in the sky<br>
              The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br>
              Scarce heard amid the guns below.</p>
              <p>We are the Dead. Short days ago<br>
              We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br>
              Loved and were loved, and now we lie,<br>
              In Flanders fields.</p>
              <p>Take up our quarrel with the foe:<br>
              To you from failing hands we throw<br>
              The torch; be yours to hold it high.<br>
              If ye break faith with us who die<br>
              We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br>
              In Flanders fields.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Unrest</em></strong> (2020), for solo clarinet, is a reflection of the time we are currently experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <div class="workContent">
          <p>Hongwei Cai’s composition <strong><em>Soaring Over a Storm</em></strong> showcases the violin as more than a technically proficient instrument, but as a conduit for the emotional and narrative arc of the piece. The composer effectively employs harmonics to imbue the music with an ethereal quality, evoking a mystical and supernatural atmosphere that enhances the evocative representation of the bird’s journey through a turbulent storm. The violin’s unique utilization adds to the overall impression of the instrument as if engaged in a struggle against the chaos, evident in the forceful bow strokes that convey a sense of battling against the storm. Notably, the piece offers moments of stillness and introspection, contributing to a dynamic range and interplay of emotions that culminates in a dramatic climax, creating a deeply moving and unforgettable musical experience. Cai’s proficiency in fully utilizing the expressive capabilities of the violin demonstrates his compositional skill and highlights the enduring appeal of this beloved instrument.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Inspired by Dorothea Tanning’s painting Temp&ecirc;te en jaune, my solo cello piece <strong><em>Tempest in Yellow</em></strong> is a reflection while studying the painting, which is found in the Minneapolis Institute of Art. At first glance, the details in the painting were not easy to make out, except for the foreshortened woman’s face. Four major parts, unveiled from the fragmented yellow canvas, hazily connected one with another, creating a circle as if revealing something hidden behind the canvas. Through its static frame, I perceive a dynamic image and abundant energy hidden within the warm tones. The painting conveys meaning through the viewer’s experience, which is similar to our experience listening to music: people with different personal experiences interpret musical works differently. With regard to my composition, motifs, themes, and gestures came from my imagination when gazing at the painting, and I attempt to present the music in a way that corresponds with Tanning’s original painting.</p>

        <div class="workContent">
          <p>Partly inspired by Michael Jackson’s song Heal the World, my string quartet <strong><em>Attainment of the other shore</em></strong> is an imaginary journey searching for a “place” where there is no damage or hurt, sorrow or fear. The music begins moaning-like and is slow-paced, constantly changing timbre with a dark expression. After a sudden flash — a metaphor for the dawn of hope—, the music shifts, sending a signal to God asking a way to travel from shore to shore. After a difficult trek, the “place” appears unexpectedly. It is quiet and peaceful, like a beautiful meadow, birds singing and with flowers fragrant. Everything is created in beauty and exists in harmonious coexistence.<br>The music is dedicated to all the beautiful things in the world.</p>

These scenes, which are depicted musically by creating certain kind of moods, feelings, and atmospheres, are presented quickly and connected seamlessly. The piece begins with the pitch F and gradually introduces a striking and exploding gesture. After three times, the music restarts with a soft ostinato and undergoes a couple of developments as the tension continuously buildst o the climax, after which returns to the same pitch F as an echo of the beginning.</p>
